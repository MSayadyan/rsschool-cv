## Code example:
##### My solution to the task from CodeWars:
Complete the function that accepts a string parameter, and reverses each word in the string. All spaces in the string should be retained.

Examples
"This is an example!" ==> "sihT si na !elpmaxe"
"double  spaces"      ==> "elbuod  secaps"

```
function reverseWords(str) {
  return str
  .split(" ")
  .map(word => word.split("").reverse().join(""))
  .join(" ")
};

reverseWords('The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.');
```
